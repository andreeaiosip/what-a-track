## What a Track
*** 
This project is created for the Interactive Frontend Development module at the **Full Stack Software Development Course** with **Code Institute**.

**The brief:** 
_Project purpose_: Presentation of interactive data
In this project, you'll build an interactive front-end site. The site should respond to the users' actions, allowing users to actively engage with data, alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals.

_Main Technologies Required_: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

_Optional_: jQuery, d3.js, crossfilter and/or dc.js, any other JavaScript libraries, SaSS, external APIs.

_Value provided_:
Users are able to interact with the site in their particular way, to achieve their personal goals and derive answers to their specific questions.
The site owner advances their own goals by providing this functionality, potentially by being a regular user themselves.

**THE IDEA**
I’ve always been interested in discovering new music, so I choose to bring my passion for music into this project.

**What a Track is a lyrics finder website created with the API’s data from Musixmatch.com.**
Musixmatch is world’s largest lyrics database with more than 14 million lyrics in over 50 distinct languages. 

I had to sign up and register my app on their website to get an API key. I have signed up for the Not Commercial Use plan, free to use version (personal use and beta testing). 
The Not Commercial Use plan allows 2000 API Calls per day, 500 Lyrics display per day and after I've reached those limit I'll get a 401 Error. Only 30% of the lyrics will be displayed. In order to get the full view I’ll need to buy a Licensing Data Package.

### The need:
Music lovers who want to know the exact lyrics of a song. Could be just as a curiosity and knowledge or even for a karaoke session.
### The goals of this website are:
* Provide a clean feel and easy to navigate website, on mobile and desktop;
* Offer a wide range of lyrics to the user;

***
###  UX Design
Common characteristics of a user:
* Music lover;
* Computer literate;

#### Initial design wire-frames / mock-ups:

##### Mobile view
##### Desktop view

I had to change from the initial design concept of wireframes and structure because the initial concept was very complex and would've taken more time to implement all the APIs I wanted to use: Musixmatch and Songkick.
I have decided to make a simple lyrics search app and not have the gigs list displayed for the artists.

##### Final Mobile View

##### Final Desktop View


#### Client stories:

* As **a user** I want to easily look up for the lyrics of a song.
* As **a user** I want to be able to read clearly the lyrics on mobile and desktop.
* As **a user** I want to able to find the title of a song from an artist I know, so I can get the lyrics.
* As **a user** I want to able to connect on social media to keep me updated on what new lyrics are added to their site.*
