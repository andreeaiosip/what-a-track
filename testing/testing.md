### TESTING
When I have first started the project, I thought I could use the _fetch_ method. After lots of research and two full weeks of trying to make it work through _fetch_ method, I have started asking more people if they could help me. My colleague Sean Murphy told me I should use AJAX instead, because is a better tool for the response Musixmatch is sending back.

During development I have used constantly the console in Google Chrome to check for errors, so I can fix them before I save my work.

[Esprima: Syntax Validator](https://esprima.org/demo/validate.html) was used to check main.js file for any syntax errors. All code is valid and does not contain any syntax errors.

W3C was used to validate the HTML and CSS code. All code is valid.

I have user  Responsinator to see how the site looks like on different screen. Please see here [Responsinator](andreeaiosip.github.io/what-a-track/](http://www.responsinator.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fandreeaiosip.github.io%2Fwhat-a-track%2F)). 

I have performed various tests on what actions the user might take on the site and the results can be found in this [table](https://andreeaiosip.github.io/what-a-track/).

_Interesting bugs:__
I had issue with the background image, which doesn't look the same on all devices. Sometimes it's streches out. I did lots of research and I have tried out a few variations of code, but it didn't fix the problem 100%.
When the modal opens to show the lyrics, the background image does move a little. Again, I have tried many times to fix this, but I couldn't find the bug.
